The analysis of Amazon sales data reveals key performance insights across multiple dimensions. Total profit stood at $797.1M, with revenue reaching $2,409.7M, and total units sold amounted to 9.1M, averaging 24.31 days for shipment. Sub-Saharan Africa emerged as the most profitable region, followed by Europe and the Middle East, while countries like the United Kingdom, Mongolia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo significantly contributed to profits. In contrast, regions such as North America and India showed relatively low profits, suggesting potential areas for strategic improvement. Offline sales ($1,425.39M) far outpaced online sales ($984.28M), indicating a robust performance in offline channels but highlighting an opportunity for growth in the online sector. Orders peaked in 2012 at 485 but have steadily declined, reaching a low of 90 in 2017, with a parallel decrease in total costs from $389.59M in 2012 to $101.8M in 2017. Revenue followed a similar declining trend, peaking in 2012 at $555.39M and dropping to $152.41M by 2017, while average shipment days decreased from a high of 26.9 days in 2011 to 18.9 days in 2017. This analysis underscores the need to address declining revenue and order volumes, optimize online sales strategies, and explore growth opportunities in lower-profit regions and countries.
